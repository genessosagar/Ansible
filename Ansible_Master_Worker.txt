Make sure there is a connectivity between Ansible Master and Worker
Login to both Master and Worker and execute the following commands

# Update the servers
$ sudo apt updpate

# Create ansible user
$ sudo useradd -m ansible --shell /bin/bash

Become a root user
$ sudo -i

# Give ansible user sudo access
$ vi /etc/suoders
Add the following line
ansible ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

# Switch to ansible user
$ su ansible
$ sudo apt update
$ cd ~

# On the MASTER server generate new ssh keys
$ ssh-keygen
This will generate private -> id_rsa key and public id_rsa.pub

# On the WORKER server
$ cd ~
$ ls -la (Observe if .ssh directory is there or not, if it doesn't exist, create one manually)
$ mkdir .ssh
$ cd .ssh
$ vi authorized_keys
Copy the content of newly generated public key from master server and paste in this file

# Go to the master server and try ssh to worker node, it should not prompt for any password
$ ssh 

Software Pre-requisities
------------------------
1. Python on both Master and Worker (ubuntu comes with python installed)
2. Install Ansible on Master Node
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt install ansible

On Master server
----------------
After installing ansible
We have a default configuration files in ansible
$ cd /etc/ansible

Inventory File
--------------
/etc/ansible/hosts -> default available inventory file
This is where we will add the inventory
Inventory is nothing but the list of IPs we want ansible to connect and configure desired packages
Add the Worker IPs in the inventory file

$ sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
[backend]  # Name of the group
172.31.3.82
